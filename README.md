# odin-recipes
This project is an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

Prequisites for this lesson include setting up a git repository & ssh key. In my case, it also required setting up WSL (Ubuntu) for Windows.

This project demonstrates basic HTML & Git skills:

* **git** clone, add, and push
* **html** images, links and lists
